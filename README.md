# Fyber Challenge App

This is a small test app acting as a client for the [Fyber Mobile Offer API](http://developer.fyber.com/content/current/ios/offer-wall/offer-api/) to retrieve offers for specific users. It is a slimmed down rails app without ActiveRecord and ActionMailer. You can also check out the deployed version here: https://fyber-challenge-app.herokuapp.com/ (You'll probably have to turn of your ad blocker to see images).
